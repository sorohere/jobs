It's a collaborative, entrepreneurial, and fast-paced culture. You'll have the opportunity to learn, interact directly with seasoned product executives, grow your skills, and enhance your career while helping solve important problems and achieve Legion's mission. Our industry-leading, intelligent automation is powered by Legion's Workforce Management (WFM) platform, which maximizes labor efficiency and employee engagement simultaneously. In a recent Forrester Total Economic Impact study, Legion WFM was proven to deliver 13x ROI through schedule optimization, reduced attrition, increased productivity, and increased operational efficiency. Legion has been recognized for its innovative, modern approach to transforming workforce management \u2013 Inc. 5000 fastest-growing private companies in America, Forbes' Next Billion Dollar Startups, JMP Securities' Hot 100 List of the Best Privately Held Software Companies, recognized for its industry-leading AI technology by with back to back AI Breakthrough and Artificial Intelligence awards, and named a Gartner Cool Vendor. Legion is backed by Norwest Venture Partners, Stripes, First Round Capital, XYZ Ventures, Webb Investment Network, Workday Ventures, and NTT DOCOMO Ventures.BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITYThere are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees.The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options.Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously. Legion WFM was built for the cloud, designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is comprised of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.For more information, visit https://legion.coCOMPENSATION & BENEFITSAt Legion, we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages to all employees.

    "job_description": "Hi, this is Arpana, one of the founding members of Fresh Prints. In December 2016, I came across a job post on Naukri from Jacob Goodman, one of the co-owners of Fresh Prints. They were looking for someone to lead their Operations team in India. The post had already been taken down, but I decided to send Jacob an email anyway. To my surprise, he replied, and soon I found myself stepping into what would be a life-changing opportunity.During the interview process, it became clear just how new everything was. There was no office, no payroll system, no established infrastructure at all. But what struck me was Jacob and Josh's unwavering belief in the vision they had for Fresh Prints. They didn't have all the answers, but their passion was contagious, and I knew I wanted to be part of building something from the ground up. So, I jumped in. I found an office, figured out payroll, and brought in my childhood best friend to help get things off the ground. There were so many unknowns in those early days, but that's exactly what made it so exciting.I had the chance to wear multiple hats, solve problems on the fly, and help build something tangible. What started as a team of two quickly grew, and over the next few years, we scaled operations across Finance, Tech, and Marketing.As the first employee of Fresh Prints India, I've been lucky enough to help shape this company from its earliest stages. After a short break to have my daughter, I returned to lead HR and recruiting. We've gone from a scrappy startup to a team of 400+ people across three countries. But the truth is, even with all that growth, we know it's still day 1.One of the things I'm most proud of is how we made it through COVID-19 together. I still remember March 15, 2020\u2014Josh, our co-owner and CEO, sent an email to everyone announcing that the office was shutting down indefinitely. Just like so many people around the world, we were suddenly isolated from the routines and connections we relied on. We were nervous and found ourselves staring down a financial cliff.In a matter of weeks, we went from million-dollar months to zero revenue. All universities closed. All events stopped.But we'd been planning for the worst for years. From day 1 we knew we'd have to make our balance sheet a strength. We figured negative events were inevitable and our stress test was to always make sure we could operate for at least year of 0 revenue without making layoffs. When Covid hit, we were scared, but felt prepared.And as we struggled to adapt, something unexpected happened\u2014we pivoted. As PPE demand soared, we initially hesitated, but then realized this was exactly what the world needed. Shifting from tees to PPE wasn't just a business decision; it was about showing up in a way that mattered. The entire team rallied behind the idea, and our adaptability and speed helped us keep going.While so many companies were just trying to survive, Fresh Prints not only made it but even grew. It wasn't easy, but this experience showed me how deeply committed we are to each other and our mission. The grit and determination we built in those tough times, that willingness to adapt and keep each other steady\u2014it's what defines us today.The opportunities that were available to me when I joined as the first employee are still here today! In fact, they're bigger now than ever. We're at an exciting point in our journey, and we're looking for people who want to have a massive impact on the next chapter of this story.If you're someone who sees opportunity and isn't afraid to chase it, this is the role for you. We're looking for someone to take ownership, challenge the norm, and help us build something that lasts. Fresh Prints is a place where there are no limits.

As the country's fastest-growing quick-commerce company, we deliver groceries and essentials in 10 minutes flat. This speed is not just a promise; it's the result of a complex, high-throughput technology and operations backbone that operates at an unprecedented scale.Our environment is defined by rapid innovation, immense scale, and the challenge of solving complex problems that have never been solved before. We are building the future of commerce, and we need brilliant minds to help us build it securely.About the Team & The RoleThe Cybersecurity team at Zepto is a core part of the engineering organization. Our mission is to secure our products, platforms, and customers by embedding security into the DNA of everything we build. We aren't just a compliance function or a team that finds vulnerabilities; we are builders and problem-solvers who create foundational security solutions that allow Zepto to scale safely.We are looking for a Product Security Engineer who thinks like an engineer first and a security expert second. This is not a traditional pentesting role. You will not just be breaking things\u2014you will be building the tools, systems, and processes to prevent them from breaking in the first place. You will be a trusted security partner to our product and engineering teams, shaping the future of our architecture and enabling developers to ship secure code at lightning speed.What You\u2019ll Do (Responsibilities)As a Product Security Engineer, you will:Design & Architect: Act as a security subject matter expert for engineering and product teams. Conduct in-depth architecture reviews, threat modeling, and design reviews for new features and services.Automate Everything: Build and implement automated security solutions within our CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps). You will be responsible for our SAST, DAST, SCA, and secret scanning infrastructure, focusing on reducing noise and providing actionable, high-fidelity alerts to developers.Build Security Tooling: Identify gaps in our security posture and build custom tools and platforms to solve them. Whether it\u2019s a framework for secure service-to-service communication or a platform for managing secrets, you will own the solution from concept to production.Secure Code & Dependencies: Perform deep-dive manual and automated code reviews to identify complex security flaws. Drive our Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and secret management strategies, ensuring best practices are followed across the organization.Lead Security Initiatives: Own and drive large-scale security initiatives across the company, such as implementing a new authentication service, rolling out a web application firewall, or hardening our cloud infrastructure.Share Knowledge & Innovate: Mentor engineers on secure coding practices, write technical blog posts about the novel problems you're solving, present your work at conferences, and contribute back to the open-source community.What We\u2019re Looking For (Qualifications)Engineering Mindset: A strong passion for solving complex problems with code. You are proficient in at least one programming language (e.g., Python, Go, Java, JavaScript) and are comfortable building security focused tools.Deep Security Expertise: A solid understanding of application security (AppSec) fundamentals. You know the OWASP Top 10 like the back of your hand but, more importantly, you understand the underlying vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them at scale.Hands-On Experience: Proven experience in areas like threat modeling, secure code review, and security automation. While you can perform a VAPT, you are more interested in automating the discovery and prevention of those vulnerabilities.DevSecOps Acumen: Experience integrating security tools into CI/CD pipelines and a strong belief in shifting security left.Excellent Communicator: You can clearly articulate complex security risks to both technical and non-technical audiences and can influence engineering teams without direct authority.Ownership & Drive: A proactive and self-driven attitude. You don't wait for tasks; you identify problems and take ownership of the solutions.Why Join Us?Unparalleled Impact: Zepto is growing at an explosive rate. The solutions you build will have a direct and immediate impact on the security of millions of users and will be critical to the company's success.Solve for Scale: The challenges we face are unique. You won't be applying off-the-shelf solutions; you will be building for a scale and speed that few companies can match.Culture of Engineering: We are a tech-first company that values deep technical expertise. You will be surrounded by a world-class team of engineers to learn from and collaborate with.Greenfield Opportunities: Our security function is young and growing. You will have the opportunity to build things from the ground up and shape the future of our security posture.Growth & Learning: We encourage our team to be thought leaders. You'll have the support to write blogs, speak at events, and contribute to open-source projects that elevate both your and Zepto's reputation in the security community.If you are an engineer who is passionate about security and wants to build resilient, scalable systems in a hyper-growth environment, we would love to hear from you.",

    "job_description": "Forget product management. This is product creation at its purest. You're not tracking metrics—you're defining which ones matter. Not implementing someone else's vision—you're the architect translating bold ideas into tangible reality.Step directly into the founder's mind as you join Ephor, a revolutionary AI education platform redefining learning itself. No bureaucratic layers. No watered-down communication chains. Just you and the founder, in lockstep, transforming ambitious concepts into crystal-clear direction that engineers can execute with confidence.At Trilogy, our philosophy is simple: we don't just build products—we craft thought leadership. Ephor exemplifies this approach, representing far more than another AI-enhanced application. It's an ecosystem of intelligent agents, sophisticated multi-model orchestration, and dynamic knowledge synthesis. Your mission? Make the strategic backbone undeniable through compelling briefs, decision frameworks, strategic pivots, and evolutionary thinking that propels the product forward with unwavering purpose.While this remote position offers genuine timezone flexibility, you'll need to carve out 2-3 hours daily that overlap with U.S. business hours to maintain essential connections.If you require predefined success metrics, established roadmaps, or managerial guidance to function—this role will devastate you.But if you flourish amid uncertainty, extracting order from chaos through powerful writing, strategic thinking, and collaborative conviction—this could be where you produce your career's most meaningful work.What You Will Be DoingCrafting incisive, high-impact strategic product briefs that transform founder vision into actionable clarity for engineering teams.Structuring nuanced product decisions through comprehensive tradeoff analysis, user impact assessment, and strategic recommendations.Detecting crucial strategic pivots by synthesizing user feedback patterns, technical boundaries, and emerging AI capabilities.Building and evolving product principles into AI-compatible knowledge frameworks that enhance team-wide understanding.Collaborating directly with the founder to refine, challenge, and sharpen product direction—establishing trust through precision and results.What You Won’t Be DoingOverseeing sprint boards, tracking story points, or managing delivery timelines—this isn't project management.Navigating through hierarchical communication channels—you'll connect directly with key decision-makers.Deploying feature lists without strategic foundation—your work creates that foundation.Hovering over development teams or controlling execution details—your influence stems from clarity, not authority.Adhering to rigid 9-5 EST schedules—genuine timezone flexibility exists, requiring only 2-3 hours of U.S. business hour overlap.Startup Lead Key ResponsibilitiesTransform visionary concepts into precise product strategies that unify teams, illuminate decision pathways, and architect the future landscape of AI-enhanced learning experiences.Basic RequirementsMinimum 6 years of progressive experience in product strategy, management, consulting, or business development roles, featuring increasing strategic responsibility and executive partnerships.Recent tenure as Senior Product Manager, Strategy Lead, or Chief of Staff within a high-growth, founder-directed organization.Proven capability to convert high-level vision into executable product direction—complete with distinct positioning, clear tradeoffs, and viable implementation paths.Firsthand experience collaborating with founders in startup environments—successfully translating vision into strategy while thriving in conditions of ambiguity, velocity, and high-trust decision frameworks.Demonstrated history of shaping product direction through methodical strategic writing—including comprehensive briefs, narratives, and positioning documents.Evident comfort navigating ambiguity, implementing rapid iterations, and managing complexity—this role transcends process-driven product management.Deep, practical AI literacy—you've personally built with LLMs or leveraged AI to enhance product thinking and understand MCP, agentic workflows, and orchestration frameworks.Superior written and verbal communication skills—this position emphasizes documentation over meetings.Availability to maintain 2-3 hours of daily overlap with U.S. business hours.About TrilogyHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs.

You often lead or join steering committees, where you evaluate progress on foundational platforms and innovation pipelines in the core systems managed by your team, equally joining steercoms across functions to ensure fidelity of R&D product data required for operations. Often the week begins with focusing on the high priority programmes, for example, Artwork Automation or Digital Thread. These high priority programmes are cross function, involve complex interfaces and architectures and fragmented processes and ecosystem engagements. The early part of the week always ends with decisions and actions including stoppage of some workstreamsMidweek is a blend of deep dives and decision-making. You might host sessions with product owners and architects to assess solution maturity, prioritize capability builds, or refine the digital thread strategy. You also engage with external partners and vendors, balancing innovation with enterprise readiness.

You often collaborate with peers to drive cross-functional synergies.Fridays are for reflection and foresight. You review dashboards, prep for leadership updates, and shape narratives for upcoming forums. You also carve out time to explore the merging space for BG R&D i.e new B&W formats, and imagineering potential Data/Tech/People to deliver these ambitions or explore emerging tech—instrument integrations for Smart Labs, native AI services or new Change organizational constructs.

CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come truehere’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it betterat CRED, technology is the backbone that fuels problem-solving at speed and scale with smartness. we have a good share of left-brain/right-brain engineers who solve complex problems, yet at creative best in crafting great consumer experiences. engineers at CRED are highly empowered and are entrusted to own, understand, challenge, and create an upstream impact in Product and Businessif you are a go-getter, passionate about solving real problems, and enjoy the company and camaraderie of some of the best minds in the game, you should definitely explore CREDhere’s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a backend engineerwhat will you do?lead the design and architecture of complex data application platforms, including real-time personalization services and core metrics governance systems, ensuring scalability, reliability, and technical excellencementor engineers through thoughtful code reviews, pair programming, technical deep dives, and by setting a high standard for engineering practiceswrite clean, high-quality code to solve challenges related to high-concurrency, low-latency, and large-scale data processingdrive innovation by integrating AI copilots into platforms—enabling natural language interaction for data segmentation and intelligent anomaly detection for key business metricsfocus on developer experience by treating internal platforms as products—building intuitive SDKs, writing clear documentation, and automating complex workflows to simplify engineering workflowsplay a foundational role in shaping and owning systems that act as the backbone for CRED’s real-time data applications and governance strategybuild intelligent, AI-native platforms that make data more accessible and actionable across the organizationwork with and learn from a world-class team of engineers passionate about building one of the most advanced data ecosystems in the industryyou should apply if you :have 5+ of hands-on software engineering experience with a strong track record in backend services, infrastructure, or developer-facing platformsare comfortable working at the intersection of traditional backend engineering and modern data stacks, and can design high-concurrency APIs as well as work with distributed data frameworks like Spark and Flinkhave led large-scale, complex technical projects and influenced engineering direction through your expertise, not just formal authorityare proficient in at least one modern programming language (e.g., Go, Java, Python, Scala) and care deeply about writing maintainable, scalable codehave experience building platforms that operate on real-time data streams (e.g., Kafka) and working with large datasets in production environmentstreat internal platforms as products, showing empathy for your users—fellow engineers—and strive to make tools that are a joy to usehave built or are familiar with customer data platforms, experimentation frameworks, or personalization/marketing technologiesare curious about applying AI/ML to infrastructure and platform challenges and excited to lead impactful technical initiatives how is life at CRED?working at CRED would instantly make you realise one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good companyhard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insuranceto make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the gamethere are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch"

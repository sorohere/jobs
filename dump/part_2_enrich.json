We've developed a groundbreaking, vision-powered platform that uses autonomous drones and existing equipment to capture real-time data, completely digitizing workflows that have historically been manual and error-prone. This means facilities operate smarter, safer, and more efficiently, ultimately redefining \"on-time, in full\" delivery.If you're looking for an opportunity to contribute to truly transformative technology and make a significant impact in a vital industry, Gather AI is the place for you. We're leading the charge in the rapidly evolving robotics industry, and we invite you to join us in reshaping the global supply chain, one intelligent warehouse at a time.About YouWe're looking for a forward-thinking engineer to help build cutting-edge interfaces on mobile (iOS and, eventually, Android) edge-compute devices used in warehouse environments. You'll take on the challenge of enabling seamless coordination between human operators and autonomous/AI-driven systems.The ideal candidate has experience architecting and implementing embedded iOS applications with complex logic or workflows, and is looking to design interactive applications that fuse information from human operators with ML/computer vision informed feedback about the real world. You should be comfortable working with computer networking and have experience\u2014or a strong interest\u2014in complex multi-agent or multi-actor systems. Think of it like designing a multiplayer video game, where your application integrates inputs from various sources (e.g., cameras, forklift operators, ML/computer vision pipelines, and real-time localization systems) to infer the current state of the forklift and guide the operator toward the next best action.What You'll DoContribute major features to the application (including UI/UX) of our Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Vision platform - gather insights from cameras, an ML inference engine, and an iPad application mounted locally on forklifts; guide operators to take the right action based on what we are seeing/observing in the world.Develop major improvements to our iOS-based autonomous drone control application, including debugging and potentially working with the drone's core software.Become a reliable resource for identifying and fixing issues in both MHE Vision and drone products.Assist with build and test automation, such as by introducing tools to streamline remote development and debugging (for yourself and the team).Build great tools that verify the proper function of complex, multi-agent/multi-actor systems.What You'll NeedBS in Computer Science/Engineering or equivalent technical experience.Proficiency in Objective-C and Swift, and comfort with C++, as our dual-platform application incorporates C++ logic that powers our drones.At least 5 years of experience in developing embedded mobile applications (e.g., iOS, C++) or related technologies.Ability to leverage the latest AI/LLM technologies to accelerate development.Exposure to embedded/application ecosystems (Linux, iOS, Android).Solid networking and multi-threading experience - good architectural intuition.Bonus points for...Prior experience in a startup or small, fast-paced company environment.Experience building cross-platform (iOS and Android) applications, e.g. by using React Native.Experience or interest in developing CPU-constrained, soft real-time applications (e.g., video games).Familiarity with frameworks and technologies like MQTT, automotive/embedded interfaces, and ROS.Experience with cloud system interactions, external APIs, local application storage, and other features common in iOS or embedded applications.Experience with CI/CD testing tools and software release via enterprise app deployment lifecycles (e.g., Fastlane, GitHub Actions, Firebase).A passion for robotics or other real-time multi-agent technologies, and the unique challenges found in this space.Compensation And BenefitsCompensation package will include equityComprehensive health insuranceVery flexible scheduleCustomized PTORelocation assistance availableIf this sounds like a good fit, we'd love to meet you.

Not implementing someone else's vision\u2014you're the architect translating bold ideas into tangible reality.Step directly into the founder's mind as you join Ephor, a revolutionary AI education platform redefining learning itself. No bureaucratic layers. No watered-down communication chains. Just you and the founder, in lockstep, transforming ambitious concepts into crystal-clear direction that engineers can execute with confidence.At Trilogy, our philosophy is simple: we don't just build products\u2014we craft thought leadership. Ephor exemplifies this approach, representing far more than another AI-enhanced application.

Want to work on something actually important, which helps real students unlock their potential and learn faster, better, and happier? At LearnWith.AI, we\u2019re building the future of personalized learning, and we need product minds who don\u2019t just think fast, but learn fast.This role isn\u2019t about managing a product. It\u2019s about making specific, measurable outcomes happen every week. You\u2019ll get one clear goal tied to real student impact. Your job is to make that outcome true, then prove it with data. You\u2019ll go deep into the learning problem space, codify your thinking into structured \u201cBrain Lifts\u201d that make both humans and AI smarter, and drive tight, weekly product iterations until the result is undeniable. You\u2019ll be shipping meaningful features fast and refining them just as quickly.At LearnWith.AI, we\u2019re not layering technology onto a broken system. We\u2019re building a new one.

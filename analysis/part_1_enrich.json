    "job_description": "Forget product management. This is product creation at its purest. You're not tracking metrics\u2014you're defining which ones matter. Not implementing someone else's vision\u2014you're the architect translating bold ideas into tangible reality.Step directly into the founder's mind as you join Ephor, a revolutionary AI education platform redefining learning itself. No bureaucratic layers. No watered-down communication chains. Just you and the founder, in lockstep, transforming ambitious concepts into crystal-clear direction that engineers can execute with confidence.At Trilogy, our philosophy is simple: we don't just build products\u2014we craft thought leadership. Ephor exemplifies this approach, representing far more than another AI-enhanced application. It's an ecosystem of intelligent agents, sophisticated multi-model orchestration, and dynamic knowledge synthesis. Your mission? Make the strategic backbone undeniable through compelling briefs, decision frameworks, strategic pivots, and evolutionary thinking that propels the product forward with unwavering purpose.While this remote position offers genuine timezone flexibility, you'll need to carve out 2-3 hours daily that overlap with U.S. business hours to maintain essential connections.If you require predefined success metrics, established roadmaps, or managerial guidance to function\u2014this role will devastate you.But if you flourish amid uncertainty, extracting order from chaos through powerful writing, strategic thinking, and collaborative conviction\u2014this could be where you produce your career's most meaningful work.What You Will Be DoingCrafting incisive, high-impact strategic product briefs that transform founder vision into actionable clarity for engineering teams.Structuring nuanced product decisions through comprehensive tradeoff analysis, user impact assessment, and strategic recommendations.Detecting crucial strategic pivots by synthesizing user feedback patterns, technical boundaries, and emerging AI capabilities.Building and evolving product principles into AI-compatible knowledge frameworks that enhance team-wide understanding.Collaborating directly with the founder to refine, challenge, and sharpen product direction\u2014establishing trust through precision and results.What You Won\u2019t Be DoingOverseeing sprint boards, tracking story points, or managing delivery timelines\u2014this isn't project management.Navigating through hierarchical communication channels\u2014you'll connect directly with key decision-makers.Deploying feature lists without strategic foundation\u2014your work creates that foundation.Hovering over development teams or controlling execution details\u2014your influence stems from clarity, not authority.Adhering to rigid 9-5 EST schedules\u2014genuine timezone flexibility exists, requiring only 2-3 hours of U.S. business hour overlap.Startup Lead Key ResponsibilitiesTransform visionary concepts into precise product strategies that unify teams, illuminate decision pathways, and architect the future landscape of AI-enhanced learning experiences.Basic RequirementsMinimum 6 years of progressive experience in product strategy, management, consulting, or business development roles, featuring increasing strategic responsibility and executive partnerships.Recent tenure as Senior Product Manager, Strategy Lead, or Chief of Staff within a high-growth, founder-directed organization.Proven capability to convert high-level vision into executable product direction\u2014complete with distinct positioning, clear tradeoffs, and viable implementation paths.Firsthand experience collaborating with founders in startup environments\u2014successfully translating vision into strategy while thriving in conditions of ambiguity, velocity, and high-trust decision frameworks.Demonstrated history of shaping product direction through methodical strategic writing\u2014including comprehensive briefs, narratives, and positioning documents.Evident comfort navigating ambiguity, implementing rapid iterations, and managing complexity\u2014this role transcends process-driven product management.Deep, practical AI literacy\u2014you've personally built with LLMs or leveraged AI to enhance product thinking and understand MCP, agentic workflows, and orchestration frameworks.Superior written and verbal communication skills\u2014this position emphasizes documentation over meetings.Availability to maintain 2-3 hours of daily overlap with U.S. business hours.About TrilogyHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform.

A community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come truehere\u2019s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it betterhere\u2019s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a mobile developerwhat will you do?architect and own critical features for the CRED app, driving them from concept to deployment and beyond, ensuring a flawless experience on millions of Android devicesgo deep into the Android ecosystem to solve complex, non-trivial problems, from optimizing rendering and battery performance to building secure, offline-first experiencesact as a technical cornerstone for the team, mentoring other engineers, championing best practices in Android development, and shaping our technical roadmapbridge the native and cross-platform worlds by building and maintaining robust communication layers between our core Android components and the Flutter UI, ensuring seamless and performant interactionstake full ownership of the end-to-end development lifecycle: design, build, test, release, and maintainyou should apply if you:have 3-6 years of deep experience in Android development, with a proven track record of shipping high-quality, consumer-facing appspossess an expert-level command of Kotlin and the Android SDK, with a nuanced understanding of the Android framework's internalsare a true polyglot engineer, comfortable and productive in a Flutter environment, and believe in using the right tool for the joblive and breathe performance tuning, with demonstrable experience in debugging and optimizing memory, threading, and rendering issues on Androidare obsessed with creating pixel-perfect, elegant user interfaces and have a keen eye for translating design mockups into fluid on-screen experienceshave a strong point of view on mobile architecture and design patterns, and can lead technical discussions and decisionshave an AI-first mindset, comfortable leveraging AI tools to generate functional codehow is life at CRED?working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good companyhard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insuranceto make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the gamethere are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that\u2019s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch",

We’d like you to work on a case study and present your insights to the panel. This will help us
understand your analytical approach, technical methodology, and thought process in deriving key
insights.
Case Study Overview:
In this scenario, you’re a People Analytics intern at a semiconductor company, tasked with analyzing
publicly available job data to identify emerging skills in the industry. Based on your analysis, you’ll
provide recommendations to help inform future hiring and workforce strategies.
We expect you to present the following during the panel interview:
* Data Collection – Outline your process for collecting data, sources used (e.g., Glassdoor,
LinkedIn) and data preprocessing steps.
* Identifying Emerging Skills – Explain AI techniques or analytical methods applied to identify
emerging skills.
* Methodology – Summarize your approach, including any models/frameworks used.
* Key Insights – Highlight the top emerging skills based on your analysis.
* Visualizations – Use charts/graphs to support your findings.
* Recommendations – Provide concise & actionable takeaways.
Timeline: You have 5 days to complete the task and prepare your presentation. Keep it high-level, focus
on your approach and key insights rather than an exhaustive analysis.
Dataset: You may use open-source job board data (e.g., Glassdoor, LinkedIn) or create a synthesized
dataset based on real job descriptions. Ensure your data is representative, relevant to the
semiconductor industry, and ethically collected.
